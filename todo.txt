- Use Matcher<? super Element> instead of Matcher<Element>
- Don't use different semantics for hasChildren(matches all) and hasChild(matches any).
  I think I'd rather have the same semantics and introduce a new matcher.
- See if something like http://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/issues/detail?id=62&q=contains can improve
readability
